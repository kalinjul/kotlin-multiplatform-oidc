## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you found a security vulnerability that you think should not end up in a public issue report,
please contact me personally at julakali@gmail.com.
This library is usually maintained in my free time, so please don't expect immediate response,
although I'm of course committed to fix issues as soon as possible.
If you have suggestions and/or a patch, feel free to explain and submit them, too.
